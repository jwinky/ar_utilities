ActiveRecord::TransactionalDestroyAll

Adds the #destroy_all! method to all ActiveRecord objects.  This method will destroy all records by
instantiating them and calling #destroy inside a transaction.  

Returns the collection of objects that were destroyed; each will be frozen to reflect that no changes
should be made (since they cannot be persisted anymore).

If one or more objects cannot be destroyed (e.g. due to a before_destroy callback returning false)
then the transaction is rolled back and ActiveRecord::CannotDestroy is raised.
